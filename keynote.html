He is also working as a postdoc in the Database Architectures group at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI). Mark did his PhD at the CWI, working on efficient integration of machine learning and analytics programs with relational database management systems.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font color="#873600" size="3%"><b>Abstract:</b> DuckDB is a fast analytical embedded database system that has been designed with modularity and extensibility in mind. For users, it is important that DuckDB can efficiently interface directly with many different storage formats, and that DuckDB can be easily extended with their own functionality. Many users are also interested in using only parts of the system, for example the execution engine, or the parsing layer. For researchers working with DuckDB, it is important that they can easily extend the system at various layers with their own algorithms. In this talk I will talk about the modularity and extensibility of the DuckDB system, and the various system design decisions we have made to allow for this.</font></p>

          <p align="justify"><font color="#873600" size="3%"><b>Abstract:</b> Today clouds and datacenters have become the default platforms for many applications, sharing hardware resources at different levels. Though current-generation processors, networks, and storage are increasingly designed for such sharing, individually optimized applications do not easily achieve predictable performance or good overall resource utilization. In this talk, I will share my thoughts on shared software components for running on shared hardware and discuss several related systems developed in our research.</font></p>
